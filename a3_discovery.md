I approached this discovery by playing around with the switches and slider and pressing the generate button at each number to find all possible outcomes from A, B and A and B switches. 
When experimenting with the website I discovered that each letter had different outcomes, at different numbers. When I had only the A switch on while putting the number slider on 0 and pressing generate, it was named Lady Val Flowers, The cruel, this displayed two sword like objects. Then I slid the number slider from 1 to 17 consistently and pressed generate each time, while keeping only the A switch on. The outcome that was displayed within this interval was named Lady Val Flowers, the cursed. The outcome appeared to be a dog shaped image. After that I slid the number slider from 18 to 40 consistently and pressed generate at each number, while still only having the A switch on. The result was the same from 18 to 40 and was named Lady Val Flowers,The bloody and displayed a reindeer like creature. Then I slid the number slider from 41 to 99 and pressed generate at each number, while keeping the switch A only turned on. It displayed the same result in that interval which was named Lady Val Flowers, The Absurd. The outcome appeared to resemble a chainsaw like object. Afterwards I slid the number slider to 100 and pressed generate, while having the A switch on, which displayed a dragon like creature and was named Lady Val Flowers, The Blessed. These were all the possible outcomes with only A switch on, then I moved on to test only B switch, so I turned off switch A and turned on switch B. I started of with putting the number slider on 0 and pressing generate, it displayed an outcome named dog or lion shaped image the cruel. It appeared as two sword like objects, similar to the 0 interval of the A switch. The while still only having the B switch on I turned the number slider from 1 to 17 consistently and pressed generate. The outcome was the same from 1 to 17 which was named Lady Val Flowers, the cursed. It visually appeared to be a dog shaped image the same as when switch A went through the 1 to 17 interval, but with a different name. After this while having the B switch only on I went through 18 to 40 on the slider and pressed generate at each number. The outcome was named Lady Val Flowers, the absurd, it appeared to be a reindeer like creature, the same as switch a displayed for 18 to 40. The next interval i tested was 41 to 99, I adjusted the slider to each number and pressed generate. The outcome was named Lady Val Flowers, the absurd, It appeared to be a chainsaw, just like when switch A was only turned on. Lastly I placed the number slider 100 and pressed generate, the outcome was named Lady Val Flowers, the blessed and appeared to be a dragon, the same as when switch I was turned on. The only difference in switch A only being turned on and switch B only being turned on is the that the names were different, but the images were the same, the words after each of titles commas were also the same the beginning was only modified. Then I tested having both the A and B switch turned on, I first slid the number slider to 0 and pressed generate, it was named Ser Procerus Hill, The Cruel. It appeared to be two swords just like when I tested A and B switches alone. After I placed the number slider from 1 to 17 and pressed generate at each number, the outcome was named Ser Procerus Hill, The Cursed. It also appeared to be a dog shaped image just like the prior tests with A and B switches alone. Then I placed the number slider from 18 to 40 and pressed generate at each number, the outcome was named Ser Procerus Hill, The Bloody. It appeared to be a reindeer just like A and B switches alone. After I tested 41 to 99 by adjusting the slider and pressing generate at each number. The outcome was named Ser Procerus Hill, The Absurd, it appeared as a chainsaw just like switch A and B alone showed. Lastly I placed the number slider to 100 and pressed generate it displayed the name Ser Procerus Hill, The Blessed and appeared to be a dragon just like the prior A and B isolated tests. The last possible outcome I did with the A and B switches is having both off, I slid the number slider to 0 and pressed generate for each number and received the name Ser Jaclyn Sand, The Cruel. It appeared to be a sword just like the prior switch tests. The next thing I did was slide the number slider from 1 to 17 and pressed generate for each number and received the name Ser Jaclyn Sand, The Cursed, which appeared to be a lion just like all the other slider tests. After that I tested 18 to 40 by adjusting the slider and pressing generate at each number The result was named Ser Jaclyn Sand, The Bloody. It appeared to be a reindeer just like the other switch tests. Then I adjusted the number slider from 41 to 99 and pressed generate at each number, the result was named Ser Jaclyn Sand, The Absurd and appeared to be a reindeer like the other switch tests. Lastly I placed the number slider on 100 and pressed generate which gave me a result named Ser Jaclyn Sand, The Blessed, which looked like a dragon. This is also the same as the other switch results for this interval. The setting of the slider just changes what the image is named, but only the words before the comma. The name is modified depending on what switch is turned on.
